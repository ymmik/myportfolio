               <p class="font">
                <b>Low setup completion rate and usability issues identified in previous research.</b>
                <br>To begin using our security camera app, users must set up at least two devices as Viewer and Camera. However, our setup completion rate is low, indicating that many users download the app but do not proceed to use it. We have decided to redesign our onboarding flow, but first, we need to conduct user research to optimize our design.
                <br>
                <br>Issues from our past research:
                <br>• Users hesitated when selecting device roles.
                <br>• Finding live camera feeds took time.
                <br>• Users were unsure about device requirements.
                <br>• Older users skipped instructions, preferring to click through.
                <br>• Our main demographic, middle-aged men, struggled more than younger users.

                <br>
                <br><b>Enhance Clarity</b>
                <br>• Provide concise explanations for Viewer and Camera roles on the device selection page.
                <br>• Include a step for users to select their prepared devices, indicating what they need before setting up.
                <br>
                <br><b>Reduce Hesitation</b>
                <br>• Automatically assign a default device role when users sign in for the second device, based on their initial setup.
                <br>• Encourage users to use two phones on the device selection page.
                <br>• Recommend setting up the first device as Viewer on the device role selection page.
                <br>• Emphasize the importance of logging in with the same account on both devices.
                <br>
                <br><b>Minimize Distractions</b>
                <br>• Present one task at a time to users.
                <br>• Avoid overwhelming users with excessive information on a single page, ensuring content is well-organized.
                <br>• Limit the number of call-to-action buttons to one per page to prevent confusion.
                <br>• Direct users to live viewing immediately after setup, rather than navigating them to the camera list page.

            <p class="font">
                After testing our prototype and allowing participants to try our original onboarding process, all participants successfully completed the onboarding with our new prototype. However, most encountered difficulties with the original version. While the new flow appears feasible, there are areas for improvement in our design.
                <br>
                <br><b>Emphasizing Recommended Options</b>
                <br>Prototype testing revealed that prompting participants to select prepared devices for Alfred setup helped clarify requirements. However, some participants hesitated in choosing the option. To address this, we should not only set one of the recommended options as default but also emphasize the recommended option further.
                <br><b>Improving Clarity of Instructions</b>
                <br>Although all participants completed the setup process as expected, some expressed uncertainty about the instructions. We believe we should enhance the clarity of instructions, making them as simple and straightforward as possible.

                In light of the research results indicating the user-friendliness of the new version compared to the original, the final design follows suit with the new iteration. Additionally, in response to the research findings, we have refined the design of the recommended options and adjusted the instructional content accordingly.
