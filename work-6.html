	<p  class="font">When talking about foreign workers nowadays, many Taiwanese still think of workers from Thailand. However, the fact is, the number of Thai workers in Taiwan has been far less than before. Instead, workers from Indonesia have took over the majority. <br>
		<br>

According to studies, many Thai workers have turned to South Korea and Saudi Arabia for it’s higher wage. Still, there are some Thai workers said they still prefer Taiwan even though the wage is not as high as South Korea or Saudi Arabia according to some reports.

</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p  class="font">Due to the complicated political issue between Taiwan and China, the identity of Taiwanese people has been argued for a long time. The survey from Election Study Center shows most Taiwanese see themselves as Taiwanese, not as Chinese. <br>
<br>
However, some people have totally different interpretation. Some pro-Chinese media claims that most Taiwanese think themselves as Chinese. By computing those who see themselves as "Both Taiwanese and Chinese" and "Chinese" all together as those who "see themselves as Chinese" , it might lead to this conclusion.<br>
<br>
We can find the data is interpreted contrastingly by different media. English and Japanese media incline to the opinion of Taiwanese thinking themselves as Taiwanese, not as Chinese. But Chinese media or some pro-Chinese media in Taiwan tend to interpret in the opposite way.

	<p  class="font">With less and less young people being able to speak Taiwanese Hokkien nowadays, people are discussing whether we should put effort on saving the Taiwanese Hokkien language in Taiwan. Some even claims that we should not pay attention to the "minority language" since it’s not useful at all.<br>
		<br>

Minnan, also known as Taiwanese Hokkien, actually ranks the 23rd in the most spoken language in the world ,with over 4.8 millions users in total (2013).Except for Taiwan, it’s also spoken in China, Brunei, Cambodia, Hong-Kong, Macao, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
