               Derived representative characteristics that suited the product's focus on online channel users from actual user data, taking into account factors like gender, age, KYC results, investment holdings, and rebalancing behavior. Employed statistical analysis techniques during the user data analysis to identify relationships between these factors (e.g., the correlation between age and KYC results) to ensure the meaningfulness of the defined sampling characteristics. It was found that age, KYC results, and investment holdings emerged as the most representative factors. Subsequently, 9 participants were recruited from survey respondents who met specific criteria: they had used the product for a certain duration, expressed high satisfaction levels, and possessed the identified representative traits.

              <h4 class="fontsize-3 space"><b>USABILITY TEST RESULTS</b>
              </h4>

            <p class="font">
                Main tasks in usability testing: (1) Review investment performance, (2) Review investment portfolio content, (3) Adjust investment amounts.

                <br><b>Usage scenarios, from user interviews:</b>
                <br>Understanding the contexts in which users engage in these tasks is crucial for prioritizing design optimizations.
                <br>
                <br>(1) Review investment performance:
                <br>Users access the platform infrequently, mainly during deductions, rebalancing, negative situations, or when considering redemption.
                <br>(2) Review investment portfolio content:
                 <br>Users rarely check portfolio content unless prompted by market news, performance reviews, or rebalancing. They trust adjustment notifications, seeing frequent checks unnecessary.
                 <br>(3) Adjust investment amounts:
                 <br>Adjustments are minimal, considered only when funds increase or performance improves.
                <br>

                <br><b>Usability issues, from usability test:</b>
                <br>(1) Difficulty Finding Adjustment Entrance:
               <br> While overall operation is smooth, users find it challenging to locate the entrance for adjusting investment amounts. The new design's tab categorization improves clarity and user-friendliness compared to the original. Buttons for adjusting investment amounts or redeeming within the portfolio are more easily accessible. However, finding the entrance for adjusting investment amounts from the homepage is less intuitive.
                <br>(2) Information Comprehension Challenge:
                <br>Understanding information remains the primary pain point for users. Test results indicate that many users struggle to comprehend various pieces of information, such as cumulative return rate, annualized dividend yield, trends in cumulative return rates, details of realized positions, and explanatory text on fees.
                <br>
                <br>Based on usage scenarios, it's evident that platform usage frequency is low, primarily occurring during deductions or rebalancing. In terms of usage frequency, optimizing the app and performance monthly reports may take precedence over the platform itself. Regarding the platform, the frequency of primary functionalities is roughly as follows: reviewing performance > reviewing portfolios > adjusting amounts. This can serve as a reference for prioritizing optimization directions.

                After testing our prototype and allowing participants to try our original onboarding process, all participants successfully completed the onboarding with our new prototype. However, most encountered difficulties with the original version. While the new flow appears feasible, there are areas for improvement in our design.
                <br>
                <br><b>Emphasizing Recommended Options</b>
                <br>Prototype testing revealed that prompting participants to select prepared devices for Alfred setup helped clarify requirements. However, some participants hesitated in choosing the option. To address this, we should not only set one of the recommended options as default but also emphasize the recommended option further.
                <br><b>Improving Clarity of Instructions</b>
                <br>Although all participants completed the setup process as expected, some expressed uncertainty about the instructions. We believe we should enhance the clarity of instructions, making them as simple and straightforward as possible.

                In light of the research results indicating the user-friendliness of the new version compared to the original, the final design follows suit with the new iteration. Additionally, in response to the research findings, we have refined the design of the recommended options and adjusted the instructional content accordingly.
