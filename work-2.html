 <p class="font">To start using our security camera App, we need users to set up at least two device and set as Viewer and Camera respectively. We found our setup completion rate is low, which means there are many users who download our App but didn’t really start to use it. We decided to redesign our onboarding flow, but firstly we have to do some user research to find out how we should optimize our design.</p>
 <img src="images/flow_original.png" width="100%"  class="center-1">



    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Findings from Previous User Researches</h4>
    <p class="font">From previous user research outcome, we found that…<br>
・User hesitated and paused when choosing the device role,  confused about the function of each role.<br>
・It takes time for user to find out how to enter camera and watch Live. <br>
・User confused about how many devices or what device they should use.<br>
・User at older age don’t really read instructions, they tend to click on whatever on the screen to try to go to next step. This implies we should avoid putting more than one button on a single page during the on boarding process.<br>
・Young users have less problem to set up than older users —while most of our users are middle-aged man, who are not so familiar with app product as young users do.
    </p>

<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Prototype Design</h4>
 <p class="font">Goal: New users can finish setting and start watching Live without problems</p>

<p class="bold font">(1)Make it easier to understand.</p>
<p class="font">・Adding brief explination to Viewer and Camera on device role selection page.<br>
・Add a step of selecting the devices users have prepared, to imply what they should prepare before setting up Alfred.</p>

<p class="bold font">(2)Don’t make user hesitate, give them clear advises.</p>
<p class="font">・Give a default selection on device role when user sign in for the second device, base on whet they have set up on the first device.<br>
・Recommend user to select using two phones on device selection page.<br>
・Recommend user to set up the first device as Viewer on device role selection page.<br>
・Emphasize on logging in with the same account on two devices.</p>

<p class="bold font">(3)Don’t distract users with too many information. Let them do one thing at one time.</p>
<p class="font">・Only ask user to do one thing at a time. <br>
・Don’t put too many information at a single page, and the info should be well-organized.<br>
・Don’t put more than 1 CTA button at a single page. Since we have found that many user don’t read instructions and just click around.<br>
・Lead user to get into Live directly after setting up, instead of letting them find where the entrance is on Camera list page.<br>

<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Recruiting Participants</h4>
<p class="font" >
  We made a questionnaire to pick out the participants that meets our requirements. 5 participants are needed.<br>

・Must be around 30~50 years old, which is our main target audience.<br>
・Think need Security Camera in their life. It’d be better they need it but haven’t try any security camera product yet.
</p>



<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Interview and Prototype testing</h4>
<p class="font" >Time: 1 hour</p>

<p class="bold font">Welcoming</p>
<p class="font" >We ask participants to sign interview agreement and having some casual talk with them about their using habit on App products. The purpose is to let participants to feel more free talking to us under this environment. We start when participants feel ready for the tests and interview.</p>

<p class="bold font">Warmups</p>
<p class="font" >Asking participants to conduct simple tasks on their phone, and ask them to think aloud while conducting the tasks. We need participants to get use to speaking out what is in their mind while doing the task, which is important to the following usability test.</p>

<p class="bold font">Usability testings</p>
<p class="font" >Two tests are given. First one is our new prototype, and the second is the original version. We let participants to do the set up without giving them any hints, to see their reaction while setting up our app. During their conduction on the tests, we record our observation on their reactions.</p>

<p class="bold font">Interview</p>
<p class="font" >After the tests, we gave them a small break to take a rest. We ask them about how they feel about the two tests and especially those parts they were stacked or confused.</p>

 <div class="col-sm-12">
<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Observations</h4>


<p class="font" >We test our prototype and also letting participants to try our original on boarding process. All participants finish their onboarding on our new prototype, yet most of them have problems with the original version. We can see that the new flow is feasible, while there are still some parts that we can improve when doing our new design.</p>

<p class="bold font">(1)Emphasize more on recommended option</p>
<p class="font" >According to our prototype testing, asking participants to select what devices they have prepared for setting up Alfred do help them understand what is required for setting up. Yet we noticed that some participants somehow hesitated about which option to choose. We have to not only set one of the recommended option as default, but also try to emphasize more on the recommenced option. </p>

<p class="bold font">(2) Clearer instructions</p>
<p class="font" >Even though all our participants completed the set up process as expected, some of them show their uncertainty about the instructions. We think we should try to improve the clarity of the instructions, make them as simple and easy as possible.</p>
