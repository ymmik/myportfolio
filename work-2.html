              </h4>

               <p class="font">
                <b>Low setup completion rate and usability issues identified in previous research.</b>
                <br>To begin using our security camera app, users must set up at least two devices as Viewer and Camera. However, our setup completion rate is low, indicating that many users download the app but do not proceed to use it. We have decided to redesign our onboarding flow, but first, we need to conduct user research to optimize our design.
                <br>
                <br>Issues from our past research:
                <br>• Users hesitated when selecting device roles.
                <br>• Finding live camera feeds took time.
                <br>• Users were unsure about device requirements.
                <br>• Older users skipped instructions, preferring to click through.
                <br>• Our main demographic, middle-aged men, struggled more than younger users.

                <b>Enable new users to complete setup and begin live viewing seamlessly.</b>
                <br>
                <br>Enhance Clarity:
                <br>• Provide concise explanations for Viewer and Camera roles on the device selection page.
                <br>• Include a step for users to select their prepared devices, indicating what they need before setting up.
                <br>
                <br>Reduce Hesitation:
                <br>• Automatically assign a default device role when users sign in for the second device, based on their initial setup.
                <br>• Encourage users to use two phones on the device selection page.
                <br>• Recommend setting up the first device as Viewer on the device role selection page.
                <br>• Emphasize the importance of logging in with the same account on both devices.
                <br>
                <br>Minimize Distractions:
                <br>• Present one task at a time to users.
                <br>• Avoid overwhelming users with excessive information on a single page, ensuring content is well-organized.
                <br>• Limit the number of call-to-action buttons to one per page to prevent confusion.
                <br>• Direct users to live viewing immediately after setup, rather than navigating them to the camera list page.

                <br>• Participants perform simple tasks on their phones.
                <br>• Participants verbalize their thoughts during the tasks to practice articulating their process.
                <br>Usability Tests:
                <br>• Two tests conducted: one with the new prototype and one with the original version.

<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Prototype Design</h4>
 <p class="font">Goal: New users can finish setting and start watching Live without problems</p>

<p class="bold font">(1)Make it easier to understand.</p>
<p class="font">・Adding brief explination to Viewer and Camera on device role selection page.<br>
・Add a step of selecting the devices users have prepared, to imply what they should prepare before setting up Alfred.</p>

<p class="bold font">(2)Don’t make user hesitate, give them clear advises.</p>
<p class="font">・Give a default selection on device role when user sign in for the second device, base on whet they have set up on the first device.<br>
・Recommend user to select using two phones on device selection page.<br>
・Recommend user to set up the first device as Viewer on device role selection page.<br>
・Emphasize on logging in with the same account on two devices.</p>

<p class="bold font">(3)Don’t distract users with too many information. Let them do one thing at one time.</p>
<p class="font">・Only ask user to do one thing at a time. <br>
・Don’t put too many information at a single page, and the info should be well-organized.<br>
・Don’t put more than 1 CTA button at a single page. Since we have found that many user don’t read instructions and just click around.<br>
・Lead user to get into Live directly after setting up, instead of letting them find where the entrance is on Camera list page.<br>

<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Interview and Prototype testing</h4>
<p class="font" >Time: 1 hour</p>

<p class="bold font">Welcoming</p>
<p class="font" >We ask participants to sign interview agreement and having some casual talk with them about their using habit on App products. The purpose is to let participants to feel more free talking to us under this environment. We start when participants feel ready for the tests and interview.</p>

<p class="bold font">Warmups</p>
<p class="font" >Asking participants to conduct simple tasks on their phone, and ask them to think aloud while conducting the tasks. We need participants to get use to speaking out what is in their mind while doing the task, which is important to the following usability test.</p>

<p class="bold font">Usability testings</p>
<p class="font" >Two tests are given. First one is our new prototype, and the second is the original version. We let participants to do the set up without giving them any hints, to see their reaction while setting up our app. During their conduction on the tests, we record our observation on their reactions.</p>

<p class="bold font">Interview</p>
<p class="font" >After the tests, we gave them a small break to take a rest. We ask them about how they feel about the two tests and especially those parts they were stacked or confused.</p>

 <div class="col-sm-12">
<h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Observations</h4>


<p class="font" >We test our prototype and also letting participants to try our original on boarding process. All participants finish their onboarding on our new prototype, yet most of them have problems with the original version. We can see that the new flow is feasible, while there are still some parts that we can improve when doing our new design.</p>

<p class="bold font">(1)Emphasize more on recommended option</p>
<p class="font" >According to our prototype testing, asking participants to select what devices they have prepared for setting up Alfred do help them understand what is required for setting up. Yet we noticed that some participants somehow hesitated about which option to choose. We have to not only set one of the recommended option as default, but also try to emphasize more on the recommenced option. </p>

<p class="bold font">(2) Clearer instructions</p>
<p class="font" >Even though all our participants completed the set up process as expected, some of them show their uncertainty about the instructions. We think we should try to improve the clarity of the instructions, make them as simple and easy as possible.</p>
