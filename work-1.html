         <p class="font" >In conclusion, the number of users and the amount of usage are improved, yet the retention rate is not. This implies the new function we provided might not be able to motivate users to keep on using our product, they probably don't need the feature as frequently as we expected. However, the new function did help improve the overall usage of the product obviously. If we want to get a higher retention rate, we should try some other ways.</p>

    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Next Step: User Research</h4>

 <p class="font">According to the outcome of the keyword research tool revision, we found even though users did increase after adding new features, it did not reflect an improvement in retention. We can suggest—new features might not be critical features that attract users to keep on using, it’s probably just a nice-to-have feature. Still, it’s not easy to confirm if the conclusion is correct, since the team hasn’t really done any user research before. We need to help the team know real users’ needs, and make a better decision on product direction. To do better decisions on product revision, we need to know more about our users. It's necessary to conduct user research and build a persona to figure out real users' needs, which might help to find out ways to improve user retention.</p>

(1) Most paying users unsubscribe within only a few months. However, it takes a longer time to see the result of SEO in fact.<br><br>
(2) The amount of usage doesn’t seem to indicate user lifetime. Many long-term users are even with less usage and lower frequency than short-term users.<br><br>
(3) Most users have tried all main functions. Among all used functions, most users use keyword research and webpage SEO check function more than others.</p>

 <p class="font">Categorize users by the function they care about/how they use/ why they use the product, which are the most critical dimensions among all.

     <p class="font">With the persona we’ve created, we have better understand about user. After getting the research results, let's go back to the question: <span>What can we do to improve the retention of our keyword research tool?</span></p>


<p class="font">The 2 main different ways to use the keyword research tool from user research:</p>

<div class="col-sm-6 padding">

<div class="circle ">1</div><p class="fontsize-4-1 inline">Users who need new content frequently.</p>

<img src="images/persona-2-1.png" width="100%">

<p class="fontsize-2 space-2">Only use keyword research tool, doesn’t use keyword and landing page tracking tool. This kind of user needs new content very often, what they need is to find out as many related keywords as possible. They don’t think it necessary to keep tracking every keyword ranking on the landing page. E.g. Content Websites, web design companies, and new-built websites</p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6 padding">

  <div class="circle ">2</div><p class="fontsize-4-1 inline">Users who don’t update content frequently,<br>but focus on certain keywords’ ranking.</p>


 
</p>
<img src="images/persona-2-2.png" width="100%">

<p class="fontsize-2">Use keyword and landing page tracking tools often, but they hardly use the keyword research tool. To this kind of user, their content doesn’t change often. They do focus on keyword research at first but don’t pay much effort to keyword research anymore after using it for a while. They only pay attention to the ranking of certain keywords and landing pages. E.g. Online Business Brochure/Catalog, some E-commerce Websites.</p>
     

</div>



<div>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 1</h5>
<p class="font">We can see, that the type 2 user did use our keyword research function at first, but stopped using it after a while since their content doesn’t need so frequent changes. They leave our keyword tool and turn to the tracking tool. 
However, the user journey is not well connected. Even though there’re users who know how to turn to the tracking tool, some users actually don’t know there’s a keyword-landing-page ranking tracking function in our tool. It might be necessary to reinforce the combination between the research function and the ranking tracking function. We then propose to combine the research function and tracking function together to help improve user retention on our tool. </p>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 2</h5>
<p class="font">
Combining keyword research tools and keyword-landing-page tracking tools may be a good proposal, but it might take a lot of effort. Considering we don’t have many resources to do it, for now, we proposed another way to improve retention. 
After the survey and interview, we also found many users don’t really know how to use our tool correctly. Some gave up using certain functions because they don’t know how to use them, which might be one of the reasons they don’t come back and use them again. Therefore, we think it important to add an onboarding process to teach users how to use our tool. We proposed onboarding on product interface or onboarding email design might be feasible ways to help improve user retention.</p>
