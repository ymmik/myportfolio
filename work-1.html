    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Define Goals and Make Assumption</h4>
    <p class="font">
      Our goals are to increase weekly active user, weekly usage and retention rate. Product manager assumed that adding new functions that user might need, as providing keyword search trend and related keywords, could help improve.
    </p>

  </div>

  <!---end assumption--->
  <!---start design--->
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">UI/UX Design</h4>
    <p class="font">
      We added the new features:providing keyword search trend and related keywords, to our keyword research tool. Also, we changed the visual style and rearrange the interface to make it more clear and understandable.

    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Design Outcome</h4>

    <p class="fontsize-1"> Number of weekly active user</p>
        <p class="fontsize-2">The number of paid user increased 24.6%, free trial user increased 19.8% compare to previous month. </p>
    <p class="fontsize-1">Weekly usage</p>
        <p class="fontsize-2">The amount of usage grows 24.1% for paid user, and 70.4% for free trial user compare to previous month.</p>
    <p class="fontsize-1">Retention rate</p>
        <p class="fontsize-2">Retention rate doesn't really improve</p>

        <p class="fontsize-2-1 italic">( Average number of weekly active user, from web analysis tool Mixpanel )</p>

        <div class="space"></div>

         <p class="font" >In conclusion, the number of user and the amount of usage are improved, yet the retention rate is not. This implies the new function we provided might not be able to motivate users to keep on using our product, they probably don't need the feature as frequent as we expected. However, the new function did help improve the overall usage of the product obviously. If we want to get higher retention rate, we should try some other ways.</p>

    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Next Step: User Research</h4>

 <p class="font">According to the outcome of keyword research tool revision, we found even though users did increase after adding new features, it did not reflect improvement in retention. We can suggest—new features might not be a critical feature that attract user to keep on using, it’s probably just a nice-to have feature. Still, it’s not easy to confirm if the conclusion is correct, since the team hasn’t really done any user research before. We need to help the team know real user’s needs, and make better decision on product direction. To do better decision on product revision, we need to know more about our user. It's necessary to conduct user research and build persona to figure out real user's needs, which might help to find out ways to improve user retention.</p>

     <p class="font">To find out what users really need, we need many information. Besides observing the existing user data we have, we also need to conduct survey and interview to define our user persona. <br><br>

(1) Most paying users unsubscribe within only few months. However it takes longer time to see the result of SEO in fact.<br><br>
(2) The amount of usage doesn’t seem to indicate user life time. Many long term users are even with less usage and lower frequency than short term users.<br><br>
(3) Most users have tried all main functions. Among all used functions, most users use keyword research and webpage SEO check function more than others.</p>

     <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Conclusion</h4>
     <p class="font">With the persona we’ve created, we have better understand about user. After getting research results, let's go back to the question: <span>What can we do to improve the retention of our keyword research tool?</span></p>

<p class="font">The 2 main different ways to use keyword research tool from user research:</p>

<div class="col-sm-6 padding">

<div class="circle ">1</div><p class="fontsize-4-1 inline">Users who need new content frequently.</p>

<img src="images/persona-2-1.png" width="100%">

<p class="fontsize-2 space-2">Only use keyword research tool, doesn’t use keyword and landing page tracking tool. This kind of user need new content very often, what they need is to find out as more related keywords as possible. They don’t think it necessary to keep tracking on every keyword ranking on landing page. E.g. Content Websites, web design company, and new-built websites</p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6 padding">

  <div class="circle ">2</div><p class="fontsize-4-1 inline">User who doesn’t update content frequently,<br>but focus on certain keywords’ ranking.</p>


 
</p>
<img src="images/persona-2-2.png" width="100%">

<p class="fontsize-2">Use keyword and landing page tracking tool often, but they hardly use keyword research tool. To this kind of user, their content doesn’t change often. They do focus on keyword research at frirt, but don’t pay much effort on keyword research anymore after using for a while. They only pay attention on the ranking on certain keywords and landing pages. E.g. Online Business Brochure/Catalog, some E-commerce Website</p>
     

</div>



<div>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 1</h5>
<p class="font">We can see, the tyep 2 user did use our keyword research function at first, but stop using after a while since their content doesn’t need so frequent changes. They leave our keyword tool and turn to tracking tool. 
However, the user journey is not well connected. Even though there’re users who know how to turn to tracking tool, some user actually don’t know there’s keyword-landing-page ranking tracking function in our tool. It might be necessary to reinforce the combination between the research function and ranking tracking function. We then propose to combine research function and tracking function together to help improve user retention on our tool. </p>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 2</h5>
<p class="font">
Combining keyword research tool and keyword-landing-page tracking tool may be a good proposal, but it might take a lot of efforts. Considering there’re no much resources to do it for now, we proposed another way to improve retention. 
After the survey and interview, we also found many users don’t really know how to use our tool correctly. Some gave up using certain functions because they don’t know how to use them, which might be one of the reason they don’t come back and use again. Therefore, we think it important to add onboarding process to teach users how to use our tool. We proposed onboarding on product interface or onborading email design might be feasible ways to help improve user retention.</p>
