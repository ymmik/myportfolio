      <b>Retention Rate</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unchanged.
      <br>
      <br>
      In summary, user numbers and usage increased, but retention rate didn't. This suggests that the new function may not have been as motivating as expected, despite boosting overall product usage. To improve retention, we needed to explore other strategies.</p>

 <p class="font">The keyword research tool update didn't enhance retention despite increasing users, suggesting the new features may have been nice-to-have rather than essential. Prior user research was lacking for confirmation. To inform better decisions, we gathered insights into user needs through surveys and interviews, constructing personas for retention improvement.

     <h4 class="fontsize-3 space">Conclusion</h4>
     <p class="font">With the persona we’ve created, we have better understand about user. After getting the research results, let's go back to the question: <span>What can we do to improve the retention of our keyword research tool?</span></p>


<p class="font">The 2 main different ways to use the keyword research tool from user research:</p>

<div class="col-sm-6 padding">

<div class="circle ">1</div><p class="fontsize-4-1 inline">Users who need new content frequently.</p>

<img src="images/persona-2-1.png" width="100%">

<p class="fontsize-2 space-2">Only use keyword research tool, doesn’t use keyword and landing page tracking tool. This kind of user needs new content very often, what they need is to find out as many related keywords as possible. They don’t think it necessary to keep tracking every keyword ranking on the landing page. E.g. Content Websites, web design companies, and new-built websites</p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6 padding">

  <div class="circle ">2</div><p class="fontsize-4-1 inline">Users who don’t update content frequently,<br>but focus on certain keywords’ ranking.</p>


 
</p>
<img src="images/persona-2-2.png" width="100%">

<p class="fontsize-2">Use keyword and landing page tracking tools often, but they hardly use the keyword research tool. To this kind of user, their content doesn’t change often. They do focus on keyword research at first but don’t pay much effort to keyword research anymore after using it for a while. They only pay attention to the ranking of certain keywords and landing pages. E.g. Online Business Brochure/Catalog, some E-commerce Websites.</p>
     

</div>



<div>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 1</h5>
<p class="font">We can see, that the type 2 user did use our keyword research function at first, but stopped using it after a while since their content doesn’t need so frequent changes. They leave our keyword tool and turn to the tracking tool. 
However, the user journey is not well connected. Even though there’re users who know how to turn to the tracking tool, some users actually don’t know there’s a keyword-landing-page ranking tracking function in our tool. It might be necessary to reinforce the combination between the research function and the ranking tracking function. We then propose to combine the research function and tracking function together to help improve user retention on our tool. </p>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 2</h5>
<p class="font">
Combining keyword research tools and keyword-landing-page tracking tools may be a good proposal, but it might take a lot of effort. Considering we don’t have many resources to do it, for now, we proposed another way to improve retention. 
After the survey and interview, we also found many users don’t really know how to use our tool correctly. Some gave up using certain functions because they don’t know how to use them, which might be one of the reasons they don’t come back and use them again. Therefore, we think it important to add an onboarding process to teach users how to use our tool. We proposed onboarding on product interface or onboarding email design might be feasible ways to help improve user retention.</p>
