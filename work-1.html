        In summary, user numbers and usage increased, but retention rate didn't. This suggests that the new function may not have been as motivating as expected, despite boosting overall product usage. To improve retention, we needed to explore other strategies.

Prior user research was lacking for confirmation. To inform better decisions, we gathered insights into user needs through surveys and interviews, constructing personas for retention improvement.

                  <br>• User lifetime isn't tied to usage volume; some long-term users have lower activity than short-term ones.

          <p class="font"><b>Conclusion for Persona</b>
          <br>With the personas we've created, we have gained a better understanding of our users. Now that we have the research results, let's revisit the question: How can we improve the retention of our keyword research tool? From our user research, we identified two primary ways users utilize the keyword research tool:
          </p>

          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p class="font"><b> (1) Users who require frequent content updates</b>
            <br>These users solely rely on the keyword research tool and do not use the keyword and landing page tracking tool. They frequently need new content and prioritize finding as many related keywords as possible. They do not feel the need to track every keyword's ranking on the landing page. Examples include content websites, web design companies, and newly established websites.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p class="font"><b>(2) Users who infrequently update content but focus on specific keyword rankings</b>
            <br>These users frequently use both the keyword and landing page tracking tools but rarely utilize the keyword research tool. Their content does not change often, and while they initially focused on keyword research, they gradually shift their attention away from it. Instead, they primarily monitor the ranking of specific keywords and landing pages. Examples include online business brochures/catalogs and some e-commerce websites.

      <div class="col-sm-12">

        <h4 class="fontsize-3 space"><b>WHAT CAN WE DO?</b>
        </h4>

        <p class="font">Returning to our primary objective: Increase weekly active users, usage frequency, and retention rate — ultimately, leading to higher conversion rates and revenue for the company. Based on the user research findings, here are potential actions we can take:
        </p>


        <h5 class="font">Proposal 1: <b>Seamless Integration</b>
        </h5>

        <p class="font">Type 2 users initially utilize our keyword research function but later shift to the tracking tool due to infrequent content updates. However, the transition between the two tools is not seamless. Some users may not be aware of the keyword-landing-page ranking tracking function. To address this, we propose integrating the research and tracking functions to enhance user retention.
        </p>

        <h5 class="font">Proposal 2:<b> Enhanced Onboarding</b>
        </h5>

        <p class="font">
        While combining keyword research and tracking tools could be beneficial, it may require significant resources. As an alternative, we suggest focusing on improving user understanding and utilization of our existing tools. Many users struggle with using our tool effectively, leading to disengagement. Therefore, implementing an onboarding process through the product interface or email design could help improve user retention.
        </p>

        <h5 class="font">Proposal 3:<b> Refine Pricing Plan</b>
        </h5>

        <p class="font">
        Our pricing plan significantly impacts user engagement. After examining our current pricing plans and user research findings, two main issues have emerged:
        <br>
        <br><b>(1) Eliminate Free Trials</b>
        <br>The 14-day free trial is ineffective due to the delayed SEO results of our product. Users perceive minimal value during the trial, leading to abuse with repeated registrations for free access.
        <br><b>(2) Adjust Plans Based on Usage</b>
        <br>Although features like save lists and exporting are rarely utilized, our pricing is tied to storage and export limits, lacking meaningful distinctions between plans. Regardless of user type, research indicates that ranking and search volume are the most valued features in our tool. Additionally, user behavior varies based on their product usage stage (e.g., new users vs. experienced ones), highlighting the importance of considering these differences when refining pricing plans.
        <br>To propose a refined pricing plan, we first categorized users based on their pricing plan needs and establish specific business goals for each target group:
