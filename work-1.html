      <br>
      In summary, user numbers and usage increased, but retention rate didn't. This suggests that the new function may not have been as motivating as expected, despite boosting overall product usage. To improve retention, we needed to explore other strategies.</p>

    <h4 class="fontsize-3 space"><b>USER RESEARCH</b></h4>

 <p class="font">The keyword research tool update didn't enhance retention despite increasing users, suggesting the new features may have been nice-to-have rather than essential. Prior user research was lacking for confirmation. To inform better decisions, we gathered insights into user needs through surveys and interviews, constructing personas for retention improvement. Our information collection methods included:</p>

Insights from user behavioral data:
<br>• Many paying users unsubscribe within a few months, despite SEO's longer results timeframe.
<br>• User lifetime isn't tied to usage volume; some long-term users have lower activity than short-term ones.
<br>• Most users try all main functions; keyword research and webpage SEO check are the most used.

 <p class="font"><b>Dimensions for Persona</b>
<br>To construct personas, users were categorized based on their prioritized functions, usage patterns, and motivations for using the product, with particular emphasis on the duration of product usage. Distinguishing between new and long-term users was crucial, given the significant variation in their behaviors.</p>

  <p class="font"><b>Conclusion for Persona</b>
<br>With the personas we've created, we have gained a better understanding of our users. Now that we have the research results, let's revisit the question: How can we improve the retention of our keyword research tool?

From our user research, we identified two primary ways users utilize the keyword research tool:</p>

 <div class="col-sm-6">
 <p class="font"><b>Users who require frequent content updates</b>
<br>These users solely rely on the keyword research tool and do not use the keyword and landing page tracking tool. They frequently need new content and prioritize finding as many related keywords as possible. They do not feel the need to track every keyword's ranking on the landing page. Examples include content websites, web design companies, and newly established websites.</p>
</div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
       <p class="font"><b>Users who infrequently update content but focus on specific keyword rankings</b>
<br>These users frequently use both the keyword and landing page tracking tools but rarely utilize the keyword research tool. Their content does not change often, and while they initially focused on keyword research, they gradually shift their attention away from it. Instead, they primarily monitor the ranking of specific keywords and landing pages. Examples include online business brochures/catalogs and some e-commerce websites.</p>
      </div>


    
     <div class="col-sm-12">

     <h4 class="fontsize-3 space"><b>WHAT CAN WE DO?</b></h4>
     <p class="font">Returning to our primary objective: Increase weekly active users, usage frequency, and retention rate — ultimately, leading to higher conversion rates and revenue for the company. Based on the user research findings, here are potential actions we can take:</p>



<div>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 1</h5>
<p class="font">We can see, that the type 2 user did use our keyword research function at first, but stopped using it after a while since their content doesn’t need so frequent changes. They leave our keyword tool and turn to the tracking tool. 
However, the user journey is not well connected. Even though there’re users who know how to turn to the tracking tool, some users actually don’t know there’s a keyword-landing-page ranking tracking function in our tool. It might be necessary to reinforce the combination between the research function and the ranking tracking function. We then propose to combine the research function and tracking function together to help improve user retention on our tool. </p>
<h5 class="fontsize-3-1 space">Proposal 2</h5>
<p class="font">
Combining keyword research tools and keyword-landing-page tracking tools may be a good proposal, but it might take a lot of effort. Considering we don’t have many resources to do it, for now, we proposed another way to improve retention. 
After the survey and interview, we also found many users don’t really know how to use our tool correctly. Some gave up using certain functions because they don’t know how to use them, which might be one of the reasons they don’t come back and use them again. Therefore, we think it important to add an onboarding process to teach users how to use our tool. We proposed onboarding on product interface or onboarding email design might be feasible ways to help improve user retention.</p>
