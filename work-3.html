<span>Our product doesn’t deliver result immediately. </span>
It takes at least a few months to see the outcome of SEO. The 14 days free trial can’t really make users feel the value our product can bring. Some free trial users even complained the ranking of their website doesn’t improve after using our product.<br>
<br>

<span>The free trial is giving away almost all the value. </span>
The free trial version is having almost the same features as the paying version, which make many users keep on re-registering to get information they need for free from our tool. </p>

      <p class="font">
From the behavior data and user research, we can see save list and exporting function are rarely used. However, our pricing model is based on the amount of storage and times of exporting per month, which makes the plans don’t make a lot of differences to customers.

  <div class="col-sm-6">
  

     <p class="font">Findings: <br>
The conversion doesn’t perform really well. We found there’re plenty of free trial users keep on registering with different accounts after expired. They can enjoy the complete function as pay user do by this way without paying, which makes them less motivated to purchase.<br><br>


Proposal: <br>
Provide freemium plan with limited function. Let users to use for free forever, but take away a few critical features users care the most: page ranking and keyword search amount. Only pay user can have the complete product function.</p>

Most pay users selected monthly pay instead of the yearly plan. <br><br>

Make the yearly pay price much cheaper than the monthly pay price. </p>

Most users purchased the cheapest plan rather than other plans.  <br><br>

Proposal: <br>
Make the monthly pay price of the cheapest plan, closer to the yearly pay price of the middle plan. This may also make customers to choose our middle offer.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
     <p class="font">We've proposed a refined pricing plan based on our insights:<br><br>
(1) Freemium<br>
Free plan with limited functions for new users. Ranking and Google Search Volume are not provided.<br><br>
(2) Basic Plan<br>
Paying Plan for users who have just started to do SEO. The function is almost complete, only the ranking function is limited. SEO beginners focus on adjusting wesite struture and content, they will need complete ranking function later.<br><br>
(3) Standard Plan<br>
Paying Plan for users who have been doing SEO for a while. Instead of frequently use on website structure adjusting, tracking on the webpage ranking is much more important to them. The plan is with complete function and let users to do SEO in anyway they prefer. <br><br>


As for the price, since we prefer users to purchase a higher price plan and with yearly pay, we make the yearly pay price of standard plan very close to the monthly pay price of basic plan. Also, we make a bigger difference between yearly and monthly pay of the same plan. We aim at encouraging customers to buy Standard Plan with yearly payment.
